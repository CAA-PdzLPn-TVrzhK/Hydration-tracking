## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

**users**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE hydration_entries (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```
**user_goals**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_goals (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    daily_goal INTEGER DEFAULT 2000,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET` (for auth-service)
- `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`

---

## üê≥ CI/CD

- All tests are run via GitHub Actions (Go + Flutter)
- Go tests use a mock database; no real database is required
- Flutter tests require Chrome (for web) or an emulator

---

## ‚ùó Notes

- All service ports and paths are defined in `docker-compose.yml` and Swagger UI
- For Android emulator, use IP `10.0.2.2` to access backend services, not localhost's

---

## üê≥ Troubleshooting

To view logs for a specific service:
```sh
docker-compose logs -f auth-service
docker-compose logs -f hydration-service
```
